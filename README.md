# How to run it locally

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```

# Install the package as dev manually

Since this package hasn't been released on the Google's extension store so the only way to try is to install it manually as following steps:

- Build the package

```sh
yarn build
```

- Open your Chrome extension: `chrome://extensions/`
- Select `Load unpackaged` and select the `dist/js`

That's it. Now open Spotify on your Chrome `https://open.spotify.com` and enjoy the music without ads :)
